## Heartbeat Monitoring and Alert System

### Project Overview
The Heartbeat Monitoring and Alert System is designed to detect and monitor atrial fibrillation (AF), a condition characterized by irregular and rapid heart rhythms. This system provides real-time insights into heart health, empowering users to take timely actions and supporting healthcare providers in making informed decisions.

### How to Run the App
To run the Heartbeat Monitoring and Alert System:
1. Navigate to the `backend` directory.
2. Run the command: `node server.js`.
3. Either upload the heartbeats reading files (e.g., reading.txt, available in the GitHub repository files ) to the application or connect directly to the BITalino device using its MAC address for real-time monitoring.

### Repository

You can find the full project, including the reading.txt sample file, in the GitHub repository.
