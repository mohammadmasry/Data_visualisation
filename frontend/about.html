            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>
                The system uses advanced sensors to measure heartbeats and processes the data through microcontrollers. 
                The collected data is displayed in real time, providing detailed insights into the user's heart activity, which can be used for further analysis or medical assessments.
